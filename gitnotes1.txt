Branching in Git
Lets Start!!!!!

1.Create a branch

e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git branch "UITeam"

Now has we know we are still working on Master Branch so we need to do a "checkout" which means swith to the branch we have Created "UITeam"
e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git checkout "UITeam"

e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git status

On Branch UI TeAM ---> this is the output u would be seeing





2.Check out branch

3.Merge to Master Branch ur newly created branches


u should be in master branch first and the use the command below
e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git merge UITeam

it will be merged with master branch but still data is not pushed to master branch so we have to do this next

e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git push -u origin master


In case u have to delete the branch

e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git branch -d "branchname"
This will delete it fom local repsoitory not from remote u will still find this if u check it

e:\>J3TrainingLabs>git push origin --delete "branchname"


This will delete it fom remote repsoitory
