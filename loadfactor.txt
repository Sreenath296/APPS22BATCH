Load Factor is called has Threshold....
HashMap
1.Default Load Factor is 0.75
2.Hashmap capcity is 16 
for 16 elemesnt the load factor is 0.75 (ie threshold).
HashMap h=new HashMap();16 is the capacity and a threshold 0.75


Calculation

		loadfactor=   numberofelemnts/totalcapacity;

ie exe

HashMap h=new HashMap();
I have stored 5 elements


				5/16=loadfactor



Total Capcity is 16 Elements
It mean u can store 16 elemnts by dedault.

what id capacity of hashmap is more then 16 lements

Another 10 elements:

It had to  wait until all elements are filled after filling it had to resize for the newly added 10 elements.
processing an allocation becomes.

They did not want to wait tiil the threshold fills up by 100%

before it fills 100% it should be notifedor signalled to increase the capacity and reserve the address space 

My need is before it fills 25% of my Hashmap it should increse the capacity 16*2=32;


HashMap h=new HashMap(0.25);  0-1
5----->0.25-----16----32---64---128
Always have loadfactor set to lesser ratio.
