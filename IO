					Java - IO Overview

						IO-Package

1. What is IO Pacakge: 

IO Package provides  set of predifine classes and Interfaces to deal with I/O with File System.

1.  Input from Console
2.  Output to Console
3. Read Data from File
4. Write Data to File
5. Serialization

					IO

	InputStream
	ByteBasesStreams:  



	DataInputStream,FileInputStream

	CharacterBasedStream	                          
	Reader
	BufferedReader,CharArrayReader,FileReader

	OutputStream
	ByteBasesStreams
	DataOutputStream,FileOutputStream



CharacterBasedStream	                          
Writer	
CharArrayWriter,FileWriter




ByteBasesioStreams: These Streams read and Write data in the form of bytes

ex: Java---->byte---->nativemachine---->datatoafile
				
ex: native---->byte---->character--->tothe file

CharcterStreams: These Streams read and Write data in the form of characters			
// directly write each byte into its orinal character form by using unicode concept
